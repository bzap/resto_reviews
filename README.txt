Completed add-on task 1
Completed add-on task 2, except for #2 as I used Bootstrap to accommodate the images. Bootstrap implements responsive design automatically if specified. I specified 'fluid', and 'responsive' where needed.

Included are five html files: 

index.html -> The homepage displaying restaurants 
search.html -> Showing search results when pressing search in the navbar
registration.html -> The registration page 
individual_sample -> A sample individual restaurant. Can be accessed by pressing 'Info' in index.html or by pressing 'Info' from search.html
submission.html -> The submission page
